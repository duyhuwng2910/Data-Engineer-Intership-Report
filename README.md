# Data-Engineer-Intership-Report
This is my intership report with Data Engineer role in FPT Information System (FIS)

I started my internship since the middle of July, 2022. I was introduced to the company by a brother who is a former president of the HRTech club as a Data Engineer trainee. In first two months, I spent my whole time reading two books that my mentor and leader of Data team gave to me (I attached two reports respectively of them). After completing those reports, I began to learn C# which is the main programming language in my company's source code. Because I have had material of several programming languages which are similar to C# such as C++ or Java, It did not take me much time to get the basic knowledge of C# (about half of month). Next, to serve the demand of the role in FIS, I had to learn more lore about advanced C#
